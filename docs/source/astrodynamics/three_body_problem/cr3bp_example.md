# CR3BP Python Example

Using the equations of motions derived in the [Non-Dimensional Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem](non-dim_cr3bp.md#non-dimensional-equations-of-motion) (CR3BP) section let's walk through a simple example of solving for the trajectory of a spacecraft along the Earth-Moon system. 

## Problem Definition 

### Boundary Conditions 

In the rotating frame the non-dimensional initial position and velocity vectors are given as:

:::{math}
:label: cr3bp_example_ivp
\mathbf{r}^*(t_0) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.50 \\
0.50  \\
0.00
\end{bmatrix}
:::

:::{math}
\mathbf{v}^*(t_0) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.05 \\
0.10 \\
0.00
\end{bmatrix}
:::

The Earth-Moon mass ratio is:

:::{math}
\mu = 0.012150515586657583
:::

### Differential Equations

The numerical solver relies on running [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) to solve the initial value problem for the system of non-dimensional {eq}`cr3bp_eom_norm_simp` ordinary differential equations. 

:::{math}
\begin{align*}
\ddot{x}^* - 2\dot{y}^* &= \frac{\partial{\tilde{\mathbf{V}}}}{\partial{x^*}} \\
\ddot{y}^* + 2\dot{x}^* &= \frac{\partial{\tilde{\mathbf{V}}}}{\partial{y^*}} \\
\ddot{z}^* &= \frac{\partial{\tilde{\mathbf{V}}}}{\partial{z^*}}
\end{align*}
:::

When taking the partial derivate of $\tilde{V}$ or $\tilde{U}$ the distance vector $\mathbf{r^*}$ is a function of time and must be decomposed in the process. 

:::{math}
:label: odes_1
\mathbf{\dot{r}}^*
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
v^*_x\\
v^*_y \\
v^*_z
\end{bmatrix}
:::

:::{math}
:label: 
\mathbf{\ddot{r}}^*
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
2v_y + x - \frac{\left(1-\mu\right)\left(x+\mu \right)}{{r^*_1}^3} - \frac{\mu\left(x + \mu -1\right)}{{r^*_2}^3}\\
-2v_x + y\left[1 - \frac{1-\mu}{{r^*_1}^3} - \frac{\mu}{{r^*_2}^3}\right] \\
-z \left[ \frac{1-\mu}{{r^*_1}^3}  + \frac{\mu}{{r^*_2}^3} \right]
\end{bmatrix}
:::

## Python Setup

Now begin by importing Python class `CR3BP()` from module [astrodynamics.three_body_problem](https://github.com/eduardo-ocampo/PyAstronautics/blob/main/src/pyastronautics/astrodynamics/three_body_problem.py) or from [astrodynamics](https://github.com/eduardo-ocampo/PyAstronautics/tree/main/src/pyastronautics/astrodynamics) directly as shown below:

```python
from pyastronautics.astrodynamics import CR3BP
```

and define the initial state vector using the given initial boundary condition {eq}`cr3bp_example_ivp`:

```python
initial_position = [0.50, 0.50, 0.0]
initial_velocity = [-0.05, 0.10, 0.0]
```

Instantiate class `CR3BP()` with the initial state vector and set the mass ratio $\mu$ for the analysis of a spacecraft (`sc`) within the Earth-Moon system.

```python
# Earth-Moon Mass Ratio
mu = 0.012150515586657583

sc = CR3BP(initial_position,initial_velocity)
sc.mu = mu
```

For this example, the interval of integration will be set to non-dimensional time of $8\pi$.

:::{math}
t_f = 8\pi
:::

```python
time_num = 1000
sc.time = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi*4, time_num)
```

Solve for the spacecraft trajectory over time $t_f$. By flagging the argument `save_analysis = True ` the numerical solution is saved off as a pickle file. Allowing for the user to solve a complex initial value problem only once and loading the results later for post-processing. By default the solution will be saved as `cr3bp_solution.pickle` but this can be changed by renaming attribute `CR3BP.num_sol_pickle_file` to the desired file name.

```python
sc.solve_non_dim_trajectory(save_analysis=True)
```

The numerical results are available by accessing `sc.num_sol`, For convenience the position and velocity over time of flight are store as `sc.numerical_position` and `sc.numerical_velocity`.

```python
results = sc.num_sol

numerical_position = sc.numerical_position
numerical_velocity = sc.numerical_velocity
```

## Results

Plotting the results shows the spacecraftâ€™s trajectory for a non-dimensional time of $8\pi$. It appears to be stable while orbiting the Earth at some periodic rate. To better illustrate the time of flight a blue gradient trajectory is plotted along non-dimensional axes showing where the spacecraft started and ended along the Earth-Moon system.

## Moon Orbit Transfer

There are natural pathways from Earth's orbit to the Moon for better fuel efficiency using the third body effects. To motivate why we should study the Three-Body Problem I will provide some examples of "cheaper" ways to the moon.

This example starts with a spacecraft in Earth's orbit at some initial position and velocity. Assume prior to this initial state, the spacecraft was at some geostationary orbit and some $\Delta V$ was applied to get it to $\mathbf{r}^*$, $\mathbf{v}^*$:

:::{math}
\mathbf{r}^*(t_0) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.50 \\
0.50  \\
0.00
\end{bmatrix}
:::

:::{math}
\mathbf{v}^*(t_0) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.0998780 \\
0.5941623 \\
0.00
\end{bmatrix}
:::

### Solution

**Figure 1.10** Animated Trajectory of The Moon's Orbital Influence
```


As shown in the animation, the first past by the Moon the spacecraft got a bit of a nudge which increases its orbital perigee. After which it is in a loose lunar orbit as illustrated better in the rotating frame ([Figure 1.9](cr3bp_gallery_example_1)). 


### Moon Capture

Part of the art of setting up a "cheaper" path to the Moon is lining up the phasing of the Moon and spacecraft's trajectory. When done correctly the spacecraft will naturally get captured by the Moon with the right $\Delta V$. Here is a better example from a new initial state:

:::{math}
\mathbf{r}^*(t_0) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.00 \\
-0.50  \\
0.00
\end{bmatrix}
:::

:::{math}
\mathbf{v}^*(t_0) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.8733718532917388 \\
-0.5247747524101218 \\
0.00
\end{bmatrix}
:::
