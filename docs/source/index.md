Welcome to PyAstronautics' Documentation!
============================================

This package is a collection of Python modules I wrote to support my master's level studies in Astronautical Engineering at the University of Southern California. The long form documentation is for the curious readers who continue to seek knowledge and explore new ideas. Enjoy!

This work is dedicated to Mae🌻 and Moose🐶. Your love and joy inspire me every day. Thank you for being my greatest supporters.
